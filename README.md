SauceDemo E-Commerce Website Automation Test Project
Overview
The SauceDemo E-Commerce Website Automation Test Project is an automation testing framework designed to validate key functionalities of the SauceDemo e-commerce website. SauceDemo is a mock online store used for demonstration purposes, and the primary goal of this project is to automate the verification of core workflows like login, product selection, adding to the cart, and completing the checkout process.

This project utilizes Selenium WebDriver for browser automation and TestNG for managing test cases, generating reports, and running the tests. The test suite covers various scenarios, including valid and invalid user actions, edge cases, and error handling.

Features
Key Functionalities Automated:
Login: Verifies login with valid, invalid, and blank credentials.

Product Browsing: Ensures that the user can view the product catalog.

Add to Cart: Tests adding products to the shopping cart and verifying the cart contents.

Checkout: Verifies successful order completion and confirmation.

Error Handling: Handles incorrect login credentials and empty fields.

User Roles: Supports testing across various predefined users (standard_user, locked_out_user, etc.).

Test Scenarios:
Valid and invalid login attempts

Adding products to the cart and proceeding to checkout

Handling of empty input fields and error messages

Testing across different user roles

Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox)

Technologies Used
Selenium WebDriver: For automating browser interactions and simulating user actions.

TestNG: For running and organizing tests, and generating detailed reports.

Maven: For dependency management and project builds.

Java: For writing the automation test scripts.

ChromeDriver / GeckoDriver: For running tests on Chrome and Firefox browsers.

Project Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the automation tests:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/saucedemo-automation.git

2. Install Required Dependencies
Ensure you have Maven and Java installed on your machine. You can verify this by running the following commands:

bash
Copy
mvn -version
java -version
Then, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
cd saucedemo-automation
mvn install
This will download the necessary libraries such as Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

3. Set Up WebDriver
Ensure that you have the appropriate browser drivers installed for the browsers you want to test (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox). Download the correct version of these drivers and provide their path in your WebDriver setup class.

java
Copy
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/chromedriver");

4. Running the Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command:

bash
Copy
mvn test
This will trigger the TestNG tests and run them in the specified browser(s) as defined in your testng.xml configuration.

5. View Test Reports
After executing the tests, the results will be available in the target/test-classes directory, where you can find the TestNG HTML report for detailed information about the test execution.

Additional Information:
Running Tests in Parallel (Optional)
You can modify the testng.xml file to run tests in parallel on different browsers or machines, enabling cross-browser testing. To set up parallel execution, you can use:

xml
Copy
<suite name="SauceDemoAutomation" parallel="tests" thread-count="2">
  <test name="LoginTests">
    <parameter name="browser" value="chrome"/>
    <classes>
      <class name="tests.LoginTest"/>
    </classes>
  </test>
  <test name="CheckoutTests">
    <parameter name="browser" value="firefox"/>
    <classes>
      <class name="tests.CheckoutTest"/>
    </classes>
  </test>
</suite>
Continuous Integration
This project can be integrated with Jenkins or other CI tools to automate the execution of tests whenever a change is made in the codebase. Set up your CI pipeline to pull the latest code, run the tests, and generate reports.

Conclusion
This SauceDemo E-Commerce Website Automation Test Project provides a reliable and efficient way to test the functionality of the SauceDemo platform using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. With automated tests, you can ensure that key user workflows such as login, product selection, and checkout are working as expected, saving time and effort in manual testing.
